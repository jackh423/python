# First Script â€“ Decision Making
# Write a script that can determine where different plants can be planted.
#
# Each plant has a name, a type (Flower, Vegetable, Tree, etc.), and a maximum height.
# There are three gardens as follows:
#
# The Vegetable Garden can have only Vegetables, and there is no maximum height.
# The Low Garden can have only Flowers, and there is a maximum height of 3.
# The High Garden can have only Flowers, and there is a maximum height of 6.
# Print ONE line that identifies the one or more gardens that a given plant can be planted in. If a plant does not match the criteria for any of the gardens, then say so.
#
# Test the script six times with the following test data:
#
# Name: Lily, Type: Flower, Height 3
# Name: Bonsai, Type: Tree, Height 2
# Name: Carrots, Type: Vegetable, Height 1
# Name: Corn, Type: Vegetable, Height 8
# Name: Rose, Type: Flower, Height 5
# Name: Sunflower, Type: Flower, Height 8
# Example output:
#
# Please enter the plant name: Lily
# Please enter the plant type: Flower
# Please enter the plant height: 3
# A Lily can be planted in the Low Garden or the High Garden.
