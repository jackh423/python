# Second Script â€“ Guessing Game
# Write a script that plays a simple guessing game.
# The script will generate a secret number from 1 to 100, inclusive, and the user will have to guess the number.
# After each guess, the script will tell the user if they are high, low, or correct.
# If they are correct, the script will congratulate the user, tell them how many guesses they took, and then end the script.
# Hint: most of the game code will be in a loop that repeats until the correct number is guessed.
# To generate the secret number, you will need to use the randint function from Python's Random module, as follows:
# import random
#
# #this generates a random int from 1-100, inclusive
# secretNum = random.randint(1,100)
# Example output:
#
# Welcome to the guessing game.
# You need to guess a number from 1 to 100.
# What is your guess? 50
# Guess is too low.
# What is your guess? 75
# Guess is too low.
# What is your guess? 87
# Guess is too high.
# What is your guess? 81
# Guess is too low.
# What is your guess? 84
# Guess is too low.
# What is your guess? 85
# Congratulations!
# You guessed the secret number in 6 guesses!
