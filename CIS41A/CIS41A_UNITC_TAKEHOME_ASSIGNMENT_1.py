# First Script â€“ Working with Lists
# All print output should include descriptions as shown in the example output below.
# Create an empty list called list1
# Populate list1 with the values 1,3,5
# Create list2 and populate it with the values 1,2,3,4
# Create list3 by using + (a plus sign) to combine list1 and list2. Print list3.
# Use sequence operator in to test list3 to see if it contains a 3, print True/False result (do with one line of code).
# Count the number of 3s in list3, print the result.
# Determine the index of the first 3 in list3, print the result.
# Pop this first 3 and assign it to a variable called first3, print first3.
# Create list4, populate it with list3's sorted values, using the sorted built-in function.
# Print list3 and list4.
# Slice list3 to obtain a list of the values 1,2,3 from the middle of list3, print the result.
# Determine the length of list3, print the result.
# Determine the max value of list3, print the result.
# Sort list3 (use the list sort method), print list3.
# Create list5, a list of lists, using list1 and list2 as elements of list5, print list5.
# Print the value 4 contained within list5.

# 2 e: Examine the results. Can you see how they were arrived at?
# 2 c answer is arrived by performing AND on every bit of 2 numbers.
# 2 d answer is arrived by performing OR on every bit of 2 numbers.
