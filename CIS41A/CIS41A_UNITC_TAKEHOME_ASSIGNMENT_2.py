# Second Script â€“ Bit Operators
# Assign the values 9 and 14 to variables a and b respectively.
# Print the binary values of a and b (use the bin built-in function).
# Calculate the value of a and b, print the result in binary.
# Calculate the value of a or b, print the result in binary.
# Examine the results. Can you see how they were arrived at?
# Example output:
#
# b) binary of a =  0b1001
# b) binary of b =  0b1110
# c) binary of a & b =  0b1000
# d) binary of a | b =  0b1111
