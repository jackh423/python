Your feedback on this class is important to help me improve the class. Please click on this  link (Links to an external site.), which is an anonymous google form, to fill in your answers. It is a quick, 4-question survey to ask for your feedback on the class.

When you're done filling out the form, go back to this Student Survey page and fill in your name, then click submit to let me know that you've answered the survey.

The due date is Mon 3/22 (same day as the final project due date) so you can fill out the survey before or after you turn in the final project.
Since it's an anonymous survey, it's on an honor system. Everyone who signs their name and submits this 'assignment' will receive 2 pts extra credit.

Thank you in advance for your honest and thoughtful feedback. It will help me to keep improving the class.
