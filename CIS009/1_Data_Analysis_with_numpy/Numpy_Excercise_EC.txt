Numpy exercise EC
Due Jan 11 by 9:30am Points 2 Submitting a text entry box Available until Jan 11 at 9:30am
This assignment was locked Jan 11 at 9:30am.
Do the reading and work on the numpy exercises.
In the textbox, copy your answers for the questions in cells 3, 9, 15, 28.
[Update: There is a typo in the numbering of the exercises in the Jupyter Notebook. Exercise #28 is actually shown as #18. Please do the exercise that comes between #27 and #29]

You don't have to get the perfectly correct answers, you just need to show that you're heading in the right direction in order to get credit for the answer. But a correct answer would be great!

1/2pt for each question.
Since this is extra credit, it's not possible to submit the work late.
