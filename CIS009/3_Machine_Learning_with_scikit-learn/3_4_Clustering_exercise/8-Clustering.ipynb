    "In unsupervised learning, there are input features but no output labels to \"learn\" from. In other words, there are no output labels that act as a supervisor to tell us how accurate the predicted output is.  Instead, the goal of unsupervised learning is to find hidden patterns in the unlabeled data. Unsupervised learning is learning by observation, rather than learning by examples as in supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",

    "There are multiple ways to cluster data, k-means is one of the most straight forward ways. K-means is a _partition based clustering_, which means data are partitioned into k mutually exclusive clusters, where k is a user defined value. Other types of clustering are _hierarchical clustering_ (grouping data with similarity together until there are a certain number of clusters), and _density based clustering_ (plot data and group the ones that are closer together into one cluster)."

Then it puts each data point into a cluster based on how close the data value is to a particular centroid. When all data are in clusters, the algorithm calculates the mean of each cluster, and the mean serves as a new centroid for a new cluster. The algorithm keeps repeating the 2 steps of putting all data into the new clusters and calculates the new centroids, and this iterative process ends when all the newly calculated centroids are the same value as the previous centroid."
