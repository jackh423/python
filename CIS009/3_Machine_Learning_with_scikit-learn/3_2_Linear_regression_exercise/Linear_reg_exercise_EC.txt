Linear regression exercise EC
Due Feb 10 by 9:30am Points 2 Submitting a text entry box Available until Feb 10 at 9:30am
This assignment was locked Feb 10 at 9:30am.
Do the reading and work on the Linear regression exercises.
In the textbox, copy your answers for the questions in cells 1, 2, 4, and 13, 14, 16.

You don't have to get the perfectly correct answers, you just need to show that you're heading in the right direction in order to get credit for the answer. But a correct answer would be great (and since you've done the midterm, the answers for 1b should be correct, you're a pro with basic pandas operations now)

1pt for 1, 2, 4
1pt for 13, 14, 16.
Since this is extra credit, it's not possible to submit the work late.
