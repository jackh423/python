Do the reading and work on the k-means clustering exercise.
In the textbox, copy your answers for the questions in cells 3, 4, 5.

You don't have to get the perfectly correct answers, you just need to show that you're heading in the right direction in order to get credit for the answer. But a correct answer would be great.

1/3pt for each step.
Since this is extra credit, it's not possible to submit the work late.
