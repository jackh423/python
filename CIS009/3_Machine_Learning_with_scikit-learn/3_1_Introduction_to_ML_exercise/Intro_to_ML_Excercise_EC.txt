Intro to ML exercise EC
Due Feb 8 by 9:30am Points 1 Submitting a text entry box Available until Feb 8 at 9:30am
This assignment was locked Feb 8 at 9:30am.
Do the reading and work on the Introduction to Machine Learning exercises.
In the textbox, copy your answers for the questions in cells 0 and 1b.

You don't have to get the perfectly correct answers, you just need to show that you're heading in the right direction in order to get credit for the answer. But a correct answer would be great (and since you've done the midterm, the answers for 1b should be correct, you're a pro with basic pandas operations now)

1/2pt for each question.
Since this is extra credit, it's not possible to submit the work late.
