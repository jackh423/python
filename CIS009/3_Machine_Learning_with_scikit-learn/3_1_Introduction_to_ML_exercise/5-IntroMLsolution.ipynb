Even though there is a wide spectrum of machine learning algorithms, in general most algorithms can be classified in one of these three categories. The following discusses each type of learning, in order from simple to more complex.\n",

    "\n",
    "The goal of the algorithm is to learn the mapping function that maps the input to the output. So that when given new samples of X features, the machine can correctly predict the corresponding y labels.\n",

    "- Given features of a car, a truck, a bus, the algorithm can determine that a new vehicle is a truck. This is known as a _classification_ problem.\n",
    "- Given features of popular and unpopular movies, the algorithm can predict that a new movie is likely to be popular. This is known as a _regression_ problem.\n",
