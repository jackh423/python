For Lab 3, I have completed the 1st part of supervised learning. I am wondering if we will get knocked off points for having too low of an accuracy score? Should we aim for a minimum score and is there a "correct" range you will be grading us based upon?

Im stuck around the 74-75% accuracy and am not sure if I can do any better based off the data provided.

Your range is fine. It's the thought process and understanding of the steps involved that are important.

when renaming column names in data frames, is there a way to use regex or pandas attributes to rename all columns to a single word simplification at once?

 

I have been using df.columns = [x,y,z] for my assignments but am aware that this is redundant and inefficient for larger data sets in the real world.

See the Pandas solution jupyter notebook, under "string vectorization", which is step #26.
It's also covered in the reading, shown at the top of the same notebook, under Vectorized String Operations

Lab 3 u_learning Question

Will we lose points if we repeat the same steps when we cluster each two features, like we did in the Clustering exercises? Or should we use some kinds of loop, or just look at all the features together?

Part of lab 3 is to experiment with the dataset and figure out the best features to use with the clustering algorithm, so you can try out different clustering by using the same code if you like.

Lab 3 question

For the "income" prediction problem, when we were asked to get the rows that only for US workers and more than 40 hours a week, I used two lines:

incomeus = income[income.country == " United-States"]
incomeushardworking = incomeus[incomeus.week >=40]

Is there anyway to do that in one line?

You can combine multiple conditions together with the operator & (logical AND) and the operator | (logical OR)

To select country == US and week >=40:  
income[(income.country == " United-States") & (income.week >=40)]

To select country == US or week >=40:  
income[(income.country == " United-States") | (income.week >=40)]

After reading a csv file into a pandas DataFrame, when we need only a few columns to work with, which is a better way to do so:

1. Drop columns method

    df.drop(columns=['region','children'])

OR

2. To make a new DataFrame with the required columns :

     df= data[['smoker','age','bmi','children']]

Either way is fine, and it comes down to how many columns you select from the original DataFrame.

If you only need 1- 3 columns for the new DataFrame, then selecting it the 2nd way you showed is shorter to type.

If you need most of the columns except for 1- 3 columns, then dropping the ones you don't want in the 1st way you showed is shorter to type.
