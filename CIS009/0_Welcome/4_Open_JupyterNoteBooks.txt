How to open and run Jupyter Notebook exercises
After you've finished the steps to install Anaconda, this is one way to open Jupyter Notebook exercises:

Download the .ipynb exercise file to a folder of your choice.
Example: Let's say you put the file on your desktop, which is the desktop folder.
Open a terminal / command window.
At the terminal /command window, type the cd command followed by the directory path to your folder choice.
Example:  cd desktop
At the terminal / command window, type:  jupyter notebook
and wait for a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to start.
When your browser opens at the Jupyter Notebook page, you should see all your files in the current folder, including the .ipynb file.
Click on the .ipynb file to open it.
In the notebook, click on a cell to highlight it.
Add or modify the code in the cell, and then click Run (the triangle symbol) to run the code in that cell.
