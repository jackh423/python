Here is my 'plot' for the scores for the class.
Each number is a score someone earned.

95 94 94 93.5 93.5 92.5 92 92
87 87 86.5 85 84 83 83 82 81 80 80
79 78 73.5
67

 

After an exam is also a good time to check your current standing in the class.
Add up all your scores at the Grades page (including all ECs) and divide by 150, the current max total.
150 = 2 * 25 (labs) + 100 (midterm)
