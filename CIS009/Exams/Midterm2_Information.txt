Midterm 2 information
Logistics

Midterm 2 is Mon, 3/15, 9:30-10:30am. You can submit early if you're done early.
It's an online quiz on Canvas with Proctorio, same format as the first midterm (see the link "Using Proctorio for exams" for more detail).
It covers modules 3 (ML) and 4 (NLP), but as you know, this also means Python, pandas, numpy, and plotting.
You can look up notes on your computer or any printed / handwritten notes you have next to you.
You should do your own work, and not consult or communicate with anyone else during the exam.

What's in the exam

The questions are similar to questions in the labs and exercises. You either read code and explain what it does, or write a short code segment to do some work.
Each exam question will have a textbox for you to type in the answer.
If you need to make any reasonable assumption in your answer, just note it in the textbox and I will work with your assumption.
You can assume all import statements are already done, so no need to say "I assume numpy is already imported"
