Question 5
1 / 3 pts
Select the type of machine learning for the following scenario:

You train a model with many customer reviews of a product. Each customer review has a written description of their opinion on the product and whether they are happy or unhappy with the product. 
Then you use the model with customer reviews that only have the opinion of the product, and have the model detect the reviews where the customers are unhappy with the product.

Question 7
8 / 9 pts
Given a data frame df that contains airbnb rental data, where the df.columns returns:

Index(['id', 'name', 'host_id', 'neighborhood', 'latitude', 'longitude', 'room_type', 
       'price', 'minimum_nights', 'review_number', 'listings_count', 'availability_365'],
       dtype='object')
Write code to simplify the name of each column by using only the first word of each name.
For example, 'id' is still 'id', but 'host_id' becomes 'host'.

You should not have to type in each column name for your answer.

Your Answer:
My idea is this,

I will compile a regular expression to get first word without including any special characters live _ or space

Then replace the column names with new names

 

import re

pattern = re.compile(r'(w+)'

df.columns = df.columns.map(lambda name: pattern.sub('\1', name))

use string vectorization: str.replace().
 
Question 8
9 / 9 pts
Given a data frame df that contains airbnb rental data, where the df.columns returns:

Index(['id', 'name', 'host_id', 'neighborhood', 'latitude', 'longitude', 'room_type', 
       'price', 'minimum_nights', 'review_number', 'listings_count', 'availability_365'],
       dtype='object')
The 'neighborhood' column contains strings that are names of neighborhoods in a city.

Write code to convert the strings in the neighborhood column to numbers.

Your Answer:
d = df['neighborhood'].unique()

neighborhood = {j:i for i, j in enumerate(d)

df.replace(neighborhood, inplace=True)

 
Question 9
9 / 9 pts
Given a data frame df that contains airbnb rental data, where the df.columns returns:

Index(['id', 'name', 'host_id', 'neighborhood', 'latitude', 'longitude', 'room_type', 
       'price', 'minimum_nights', 'number_of_reviews', 'availability_365'],
       dtype='object')
The 'price' column has the cost per night, and the 'minimum_nights' is the minimum number of nights required for a stay.

Write code to create a new DataFrame of all data records where the price is less than 200 and the minimum_nights is 1.

Your Answer:
cond1 = df.price < 200

cond2 = df.minimum_nights == 1

new_Df = df[cond1 & cond2]

 
Question 10
9 / 9 pts
Given a data frame df that contains airbnb rental data, where the df.columns returns:

Index(['id', 'name', 'host_id', 'neighborhood', 'latitude', 'longitude', 'room_type', 
       'price', 'minimum_nights', 'number_of_reviews', 'availability_365'],
       dtype='object')
You want to train a model to predict the price.
Which of the columns above can you drop from df to create the X DataFrame?
For each column that you drop, explain why you want to drop it.

Your Answer:
I will drop following columns with given explanation. Based on the given columns, i feel "room_type", "minimum_nights", "neighborhood", "number_of_review" plays major role of the price.  

I will drop following columns

1) Price:

This is what we want to predict and hence it should not be part of X (features)

2) Id

This does not impact the price

3) name

This name does not help to predict the price

4) host_id

As I host Id also does not help to predict the price of the hotel.

5) latitude

6) Longitude

I will drop the above 2 also as that does not provide much info about the pricing

 

 

 

 
Question 11
6 / 12 pts
Given an X dataset of 3 car features: weight, hp, size  (where hp is for horsepower of the engine).
Given also a y dataset which is the gas mileage of the car.

The X and y datasets have been divided into X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test datasets so you can use them.

You want to predict the gas mileage of a car, given the 3 features in X.
You've already done some analysis and there is correlation between each of the 3 features and the gas mileage.

a. Write code to select and train a model to predict the gas mileage of a car, given the features in X.
b. Write code to have the model show the influence each of the 3 features has on the gas mileage.


Your Answer:
regr = lm.linearRegeesson(0

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size= 0.25)

y_pred = regr.predict(X_test)

df = pd.DataFram({"Actual": y_test, "Predicted": y_pred)

 

Answer for b
 
Question 12
12 / 12 pts
Why can't you calculate an R-squared value to check for accuracy, when the algorithm is used to predict whether an animal is a dog or a cat?
Your answer should only be 1-2 sentences.

Your Answer:
Predicting whether animal is dog or cat is a classification problem.

Where as R-squared value is useful only for the regression problems to find what is error percentage.

 

 
Question 13
11 / 12 pts
If you run this line of code:  

metrics.confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred, labels=[1,4])
and observe the following output:

array([[172,  6], 
       [ 4, 118]], dtype=int64)
Explain what the 4 numbers in the output mean.

Your Answer:
172 is the number of correct predictions for correct values (True Positive)

4 is the number of wrong predictions for the correct value (False Positive)

6 is the number of wrong predictions for the wrong value ( False Negative)

118 is the number of correct predictions for the wrong value (True Negative)

relate it to the labels 1,4
 
Question 14
12 / 12 pts
Give an example of when you would not want to remove stop words in an NLP problem.

Your Answer:
When stop words gives meaning to the data then I won't drop the stop words.

Ex: When we want to suggest grammar checking of given sentences or correction.
