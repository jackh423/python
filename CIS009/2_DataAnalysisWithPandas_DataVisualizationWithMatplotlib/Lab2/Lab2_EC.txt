You are part of a discussion group with 4-5 other students. There are 2 parts to the extra credit, A and B.

Click Reply to answer the following 2 questions:
When analyzing data, it's always good to see whether you have all the data needed to come to a solid and fair conclusion.
In question 6b where you plot the population of each region, you can see the highest populated to lowest populated regions. But is there a factor that could influence the population count of a region, which is not shown in the plot?
Label your answer 6b, then explain what the missing factor could be (or state that there is no factor)  and how it affected (or not affected) the population count.
 
Copy your answer to question 8b, which is your conclusion about the relationship between income level and population.
Label  your answer 8b.

Part 1 is due on the same day and time as lab 2, 1/30 11:59pm, and it's 1pt to answer both questions.
You will see the answers from other members of your group after you submit your answer.
    
After the due date of lab 2, review everyone's answers. Then add a reply to your own posting of part A.
In your reply, briefly explain whether you've changed your mind about your conclusion or whether you've learned a new interpretation of the data from someone else.

Part 2 is due Mon 2/1, 11:59pm, and is 1pt.  It's not possible to post in the discussion after 11:59pm.
